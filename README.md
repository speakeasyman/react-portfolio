# React JS Landing Page Template


### <a href="https://react-landing-page-template.herokuapp.com">LIVE DEMO</a> 

## Description
This is a ReactJS based landing page template, fit for a startup company/service with a one page view. The design is inspired by a template from <a href="https://www.free-css.com/assets/files/free-css-templates/preview/page234/interact/">Free-CSS.com </a>
All 'visual' data can be easily modified by changing the data.json file.

## My React Portfolio!

1.0 Title:
    React Portfolio

2.0 Introduction:
    This is the react portfolio I have made for week 20 of my homework assignment. It can be located here: https://romantic-lovelace-2914b9.netlify.app/ 
    The readme that came with the template is located below.

3.0 My Goals
    My main goal was to get the webpage launched. I used a template that I found online, and I modified it. There's more work that needs to be done about changing more of the stock photos, and probably the color scheme. I like the color green more than blue. There's no database attached, so the form doesn't do anything.



### The readme that arrived with the template.    
    
### 1. Preps
You will need to have <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node JS</a> installed on your pc. 

### 2. Clone Files
After cloning the files, you will have to run ```yarn``` followed by ```yarn start``` in the CLI
### 3. Add your own data 
Change the data in the ```data.json``` file as well as add any images to ```public/img/```
You can also change styles by modifying the ```public/css``` files.
